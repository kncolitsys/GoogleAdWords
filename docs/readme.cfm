	About
</strong>

<p>
	With the ColdFusion Adwords API Client Library it is possible to get access to the 
	<a href="http://www.google.com/apis/adwords/" target="_blank">
		Google Adwords API
	</a>
	(V201101) to start new campaigns, adding ads, to add keywords and so on. All with the help of a
	simple and robust set of coldfusion components accessing the google adwords api. More at 
	<a href="http://www.cfsolutions.de/coldfusion_adwords_api/" target="_blank">

				Install
			</strong>
			<p>
				The downloadable Zip consits of the following directories:
			</p>
			<p>
				adwords_api
				<br>
				- com
				<br>
				- docs
				<br>
				- examples
			</p>
			<p>
				To install the ColdFusion Adwords API Client Library you have to extract the zip file to your
				webroot directory. After doing that you have to move the com folder from webroot/adwords_api/com 
				to
				webroot/com. Requires: ColdFusion 8
			</p>
			<p>
				All examples are connecting to the sandbox. You need a google account to get access to the 
				sandbox.
				Go to the examples dir and change the user settings inside config.cfm to a valid google account 
				and
				the examples should work. Once you get your api account you can change the settings inside
				config.cfm again.
				I suggest using the included coldfusion and extjs based 
				<a href="http://www.cfsolutions.de/coldfusion_adwords_api/simple_adwords_app/" target="_blank">
					Google Adwords Account Viewer
				</a>
				or the 
				<a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-api-adwords-java/wiki/SandboxAccountViewer" 
				   target="_blank">
					Sandbox Account Viewer (Java based GUI for the Adwords API Sandbox)
				</a>
				during developement.
